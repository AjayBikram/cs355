      Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi Cuccittini (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi]) (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine footballer.[5] He plays for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Argentina national team as a striker.

Many experts and critics consider Messi as one of the greatest football players of all time.[6] Some people even say he is the greatest player ever. Messi has seven Ballon d'Or awards, the most of any player, and two more than Cristiano Ronaldo.[7][8] His playing style and skills are very similar to the Argentine legend Diego Maradona because of their short height. There is much competition between him and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo because of their similar skill levels.
